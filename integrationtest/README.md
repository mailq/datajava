This is the accompanying server designed specifically to run the Datastar SDK test suite. Its primary and sole purpose is to strictly adhere to the Datastar SDK Architecture Decision Record (ADR), ensuring that all tests are conducted within the specified guidelines and requirements. It is important to note that the code provided should not be taken as an example of general good coding practice. Instead, it is tailored specifically to meet the needs and constraints of the Datastar SDK test suite.

The server is optimized to facilitate the testing process, providing the necessary environment and configurations to ensure accurate and reliable test results. By focusing exclusively on the Datastar SDK ADR, this server helps maintain consistency and compliance with the established architectural decisions, thereby supporting the overall integrity and effectiveness of the test suite.

Run the server with `jbang integrationtest.java`
