This is an intentionally broken(!!) Datastar 🚀 backend that has absolutely **no dependency** beside the default Java JDK 21+.

😎 But at least the Hello World example is functional 😎.

## Run it

You probably never build a Java project without a build tool, but this is very easy:

```bash
javac -cp dev/datastar:. nodependency.java
```

then run the compiled code

```bash
java nodependency
```
